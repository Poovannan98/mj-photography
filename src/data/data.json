The rituals aren‚Äôt interrupted; people‚Äôs smiles aren‚Äôt crafted and perfected.

      "sub_question1": "TRADITIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY",
      "answer1": "Traditional wedding photography is the complete opposite of Candid Photography. We try to create an album out of your wedding then and there. We will ask you to pose and smile and weave expressions. A lot of things about your wedding photography are staged. Which is also a good thing because you decide what should be clicked, and shouldn‚Äôt be clicked? The order of the wedding is categorically captured, the ‚Äòsequence‚Äô of people gifting you is thoroughly shot, and the photography throughout the event is ‚Äòconsistent‚Äô. It‚Äôs not flashy, it‚Äôs very straight forward, and very studio-ish, so you will know what to expect in your wedding album. Learn more about TRADITIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY."

Isn‚Äôt it important to capture this fairytale, the way it is supposed to be? Enter us in the picture, and we will take off the rest. Wedding moments are a motion from Candid/Artistic Photography. The shots are taken cinematically. The angles are coordinated extensively such that they involve a lot of cinematic filmmaking aspects. To throw some technical jargon in, we use ultra wide-angle shots, telephoto, macro, creative shots, smooth shooting, low light shots and solid editing etc., to give you a Monsoon Wedding Part 2. This is just filmmaking at its best. Only happy endings and too many colors and pretty faces to boot, you will love watching it. :)"
